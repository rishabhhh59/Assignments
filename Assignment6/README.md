## üìö Topics Covered:
- Kubernetes workload controllers (Deployments, ReplicaSets, ReplicationControllers)
- Service types (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer)
- Persistent storage (PVs, PVCs)
- AKS cluster management (creation, scaling, upgrading)
- Pod health checks (liveness and readiness probes)
- Node taints and pod tolerations
- Cluster autoscaling (HPA, cluster autoscaler)

## üîß How to Use:

1. Clone the repository (if applicable):
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd kubernetes-aks-assignment

2. Navigate to specific task folders:

cd 1_replica_controller_deployment  # For controller comparisons
cd ../2_service_types              # For service types
# etc...

3. Make scripts executable and run them:

# Make scripts executable
chmod +x *.sh

# Run a script
./script.sh
